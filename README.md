## Overview

Choose to either create worlds or destroy them with this app. As the Creator of Worlds, you can make new worlds. Whether the world will be a star or a terrestrial planet that supports life, is determined randomly. As the Destroyer of Worlds, you can choose which worlds should be destroyed. 

When created, worlds are added to a MySQL database and displayed on the page in an image carousel. Clicking on a world will reveal the world's stats and present the option to destroy the world when playing as the Destroyer of Worlds.
